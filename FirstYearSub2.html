		<ul>
			<li>When it comes to major selection, the most important tip is to discover your inner passsion for what you really love and want to pursue. You may have heard some people talking about the "jobs that achieve the fastest growth in the recent five years" or "jobs with highest average salary" on many reviews or websites, but what you really need to do is to ignore those information and remember what YOU like and would love to study.</li>
			<li>There are many useful resources in determining your major, check out the links below:</li>

		<li><h3>What they think of their first year<h3></li>
		
			<p>"I was feeling a bit out of my element for the first time ever in my lives in the midterm season. But I then quickly figured out that my self-worth shouldn't be determined by my classes or my professors. My worth as a human being does n't boil down to my grades or my academic performance. "</p>

			<p>"The number one challenge is definitely being away from friends and families. It is hard to believe that the people you spent everyday with are now hundreds of miles away from you, and you can only visit them at most once a semester. What's more, you have to get yourself new friends and connections in the college, with the very group of people that bring you a lot of peer pressure."</p>
